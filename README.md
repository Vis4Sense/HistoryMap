# Overview

HistoryMap is a Chrome extension to help mamange (many) opened tabs, or 'supporting sensemaking' in the context of academic research. If you are interested in the research, there is [more details here](https://kaixu.me/2015/03/16/analytic-provenance-for-sensemaking-a-research-agenda-cga-2015/).


## Install

Currently, the recommended way is to install from the source in github (please use the 'rebuild-mvc' branch), becuase the new version is not fully completed yet. Follow [the steps here](https://blog.hunter.io/how-to-install-a-chrome-extension-without-using-the-chrome-web-store-31902c780034) ('Method 1: from the source code') if you are not familiar with installing Chrome extension from source code. It will be availalbe from the Chrome Web Store once the new versin is completed.

An older version is available in the [Chrome app store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sensemap/agljnpanahlilmpipaeflmnjkiiecfjb) (called 'SenseMap'). This version lacks the 'user login' and 'saved sessions' in the new version. The source code of this version is the 'master' branch.
