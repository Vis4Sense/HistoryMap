=== Install ===

There are two ways to install the sensemap in Chrome. It can be installed from the Chrome app shop, and there is a simple user guide here: http://vis4sense.github.io/sensemap/#guide. The second way is to install from the source in github. There are two branches: master and rebuild. 'master' has the same feature set as the chrome store one, whereas the 'rebuild' has a minimal set of functions. The instructions here will allow you to install either: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked
